All code is provided as is. 
As of now, I do not provide any support for it.
Code is likely to DO NOT COMPILE. It does require some changes in engine. These changes are usually some type exports.
API and code in general is subject to sweeping changes that will break everything.

This is dump of my Perforce repo, of code I made over span of years.
